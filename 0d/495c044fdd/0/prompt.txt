In the in the modules/fishing.py file, there is a command !water that lets a person say when they have finished a drink of water, and if they have done so it gives them a boost to catching rares in the fishing game. It was MEANT to be a nice reminder to hydrate, but now people are just saying it four times and then using the boost. I want to add a delay. So you can do it four times, but you have to have at least an hour between using the !water command. jeeves needs to aknowledge the attempt, but suggest they are cheating, because there is no way they drank a water that fast. Preferably in a funny, snarky, PG Wodehouse Jeeves style.
