The walls are solid brick, moss grows up each seam. The vibe is comforting.
A steady drip echoes from the ceiling, keeping time with your footsteps.
Someone carved small constellations into the stone. They sparkle with grit.
The floor is cold and smooth, like it was polished by a thousand boots.
A faint scent of cedar hangs in the air, warm against the stone.
Dust motes drift lazily in a narrow beam of light.
The room hums softly, as if the walls are quietly thinking.
You notice a chalk mark: a tiny star, drawn and redrawn.
The corners are piled with old crates, none of them labeled.
A small breeze curls around your ankles and disappears.
