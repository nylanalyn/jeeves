Jeeves IRC Bot: Command & Feature Reference

This document outlines all available commands and features for the Jeeves IRC Bot, organized by module.
Core Concepts

    Natural Language: Many modules respond to natural language. Simply mentioning Jeeves's name (e.g., "jeeves") in a sentence can often trigger a feature (e.g., jeeves, what is the weather?).

    Per-Channel Configuration: Administrators can enable, disable, and configure most modules on a per-channel basis using the !admin commands. This means a command might be available in #general but disabled in #gaming.

Admin Module (admin.py)

These commands are restricted to users defined as administrators in the bot's configuration.

    !admin reload or !reload: Reloads all modules, applying any code changes made to the files.

    !admin config reload: Reloads the bot's configuration from the state.json file. This is useful after making changes with !admin set.

    !admin on <module> [#channel]: Enables a specific module for a channel. If no channel is provided, it applies to the current channel.

    !admin off <module> [#channel]: Disables a module for a channel.

    !admin get <module.setting.path> [#channel]: Retrieves a configuration value. Use dot notation for nested settings (e.g., quest.energy_system.max_energy).

    !admin set <module.setting.path> <value> [#channel]: Changes a configuration setting, either globally or for a specific channel. Uses dot notation for nested settings. Note: Sensitive or complex settings (like API keys or monster lists) cannot be changed at runtime.

    !admin save: Saves the bot's entire current running configuration to a config.yaml.saved file. This creates a backup of your runtime changes.

    !admin reset: (DANGEROUS) Resets the bot's entire configuration to the defaults found in the original config.yaml, discarding all runtime changes.

    !admin join <#channel>: Commands the bot to join a new channel.

    !admin part <#channel> [message]: Commands the bot to leave a channel.

    !say [#channel] <message>: Makes the bot say a specific message in a channel (or the current one if not specified).

    !admin debug <on|off>: Toggles the verbose debug logging to the bot's log file.

    !emergency quit [message]: Shuts the bot down immediately.
