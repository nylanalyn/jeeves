Jeeves Module Ideas

This document tracks potential new modules and major feature upgrades for Jeeves.
1. Quest Module (In Progress)

A persistent RPG-style questing game.
Phase 1: Core Mechanics (Complete)

    !quest [difficulty] command for solo quests.

    Player profiles with level and XP (!quest profile).

    Probabilistic combat system.

    Config-driven monsters and story beats.

    Energy System:

        Players have a new resource: Energy (e.g., a maximum of 10).

        Each !quest costs 1 Energy.

        Tiered Penalties: As energy decreases, penalties are applied.

        Passive Regeneration: All players regenerate 1 energy every 10 minutes.

    Rested XP System:

        While not questing, players accrue a "Rested XP Bonus" into a separate pool, capped at a configurable amount.

        When a player wins a quest, the XP they earn is doubled, and the bonus is drained from their pool.

Phase 2: Group Content (Complete)

    !mob Command:

        A player starts a !mob command, opening a window (60s default) for others to join.

        Win chances scale with party size: 1 person = 5%, 2 = 25%, 3 = 75%, 4+ = 95%.

        !mob ping on/off - Opt-in notifications when mob encounters start.

        Global cooldown (1 hour default) keeps mob encounters special.

    Critical Hits:

        15% chance (configurable) to land a critical hit for 2x XP on victory.

    Win Streaks:

        Consecutive victories build a streak with 10% XP bonus per streak (max 5).

        Streaks reset on defeat.

    Rare Spawns:

        10% chance (configurable) for monsters to spawn as [RARE] with 2x XP multiplier.

        Channel-wide announcements when rare spawns appear.

    Leaderboard:

        !quest top shows top 10 players by level and XP with win streaks.

Phase 3: Items & Consequences (Planned)

    Item System:

        Players have a chance to find items after winning quests.

        Items provide simple, passive buffs (e.g., +1 level or +10% XP).

    Injury System:

        Even on a successful solo quest, there's a chance to receive a minor, temporary injury (debuff).

Phase 4: World Events (Planned)

    Random World Mobs:

        A powerful "world boss" monster appears in the channel on a random timer.

        All active users must use a command (e.g., !attack) to contribute to its defeat.

        Failure results in a temporary, channel-wide debuff.

Phase 5: Additional Enhancement Ideas (Future Consideration)

    Daily Challenges:

        "Defeat 5 monsters today for bonus reward" style objectives with tracking.

    Loot System (User has specific idea - revisit after testing current features):

        Monsters drop items (weapons/armor) that give small stat bonuses.

        Players can store 1-3 items with bonuses to win chance or XP gain.

    Class Abilities:

        Let each class use a special ability once per hour (!ability):

            Warriors: +20% win chance boost

            Mages: +50% XP boost

            Rogues: no cooldown on next quest

    Boss Encounters:

        Weekly scheduled boss requiring large party, drops rare/unique loot.

    Party Combos:

        Bonus rewards if mob party has diverse classes (warrior + mage + rogue = +25% XP).

    Monster Bestiary:

        Track which monsters each player has defeated, get completion bonuses.

    PvP Dueling:

        !duel @player for friendly competition between players.

    Dungeons:

        Multi-stage encounters where party fights 3 monsters in sequence.

    Guild System:

        Groups can pool resources or compete for rankings.

    Trading:

        Players can trade items/XP with each other.

2. Adventure Module Enhancements (Planned)

    Voting Items:

        Winning a vote grants a chance to receive a single-use item that affects the next vote (e.g., "Your next vote counts as two").

3. Translation Module (On Hold)

    !translate [lang] <text> command.

    Status: On hold pending a stable, self-hosted solution for the translation server.
