Jeeves Module Ideas

This document tracks potential new modules and major feature upgrades for Jeeves.
1. Quest Module (In Progress)

A persistent RPG-style questing game.
Phase 1: Core Mechanics (Complete)

    !quest [difficulty] command for solo quests.

    Player profiles with level and XP (!quest profile).

    Probabilistic combat system.

    Config-driven monsters and story beats.

    Energy System:

        Players have a new resource: Energy (e.g., a maximum of 10).

        Each !quest costs 1 Energy.

        Tiered Penalties: As energy decreases, penalties are applied.

        Passive Regeneration: All players regenerate 1 energy every 10 minutes.

    Rested XP System:

        While not questing, players accrue a "Rested XP Bonus" into a separate pool, capped at a configurable amount.

        When a player wins a quest, the XP they earn is doubled, and the bonus is drained from their pool.

Phase 2: Group Content (Planned)

    !mob Command:

        A player starts a !mob command, opening a window for others to join.

        The monster's power is a random range to ensure risk.

        Penalty for Failure: Losing a !mob quest applies a temporary "Wounded" debuff to all party members.

Phase 3: Items & Consequences (Planned)

    Item System:

        Players have a chance to find items after winning quests.

        Items provide simple, passive buffs (e.g., +1 level or +10% XP).

    Injury System:

        Even on a successful solo quest, there's a chance to receive a minor, temporary injury (debuff).

Phase 4: World Events (Planned)

    Random World Mobs:

        A powerful "world boss" monster appears in the channel on a random timer.

        All active users must use a command (e.g., !attack) to contribute to its defeat.

        Failure results in a temporary, channel-wide debuff.

2. Adventure Module Enhancements (Planned)

    Voting Items:

        Winning a vote grants a chance to receive a single-use item that affects the next vote (e.g., "Your next vote counts as two").

3. Translation Module (On Hold)

    !translate [lang] <text> command.

    Status: On hold pending a stable, self-hosted solution for the translation server.
